# Announcing the new generation of TiDB Cloud support services - Connected Care

## Overview

As customers of all sizes continue to scale their use cases and operations on TiDB Cloud, TiDB Cloud is committed to re-imagine its support services to accommodate their evolving needs. To deliver even greater value and seamless experiences, TiDB Cloud is excited to announce the launch of the next-generation support services “Connected Care” on Feb 15, 2025.

The current support offerings will no longer be available for purchase as of the launch date of the Connected Care services. However, TiDB Cloud will continue to provide full support to customers subscribing to legacy plans until their respective retirement dates.

To ensure a smooth transition and access to the latest features, TiDB Cloud encourages customers to transit and adopt the Connected Care services.

## Connected Care

The new Connected Care support services are designed in order to:
- Connect Enterprise and Premium plan customers with modern communication tools and advanced AI capabilities, delivering an enhanced and seamless customer experience
- Connect Basic plan customers with the vibrant TiDB community, fostering closer engagement and interaction

There are four layers of support plans: Basic, Developer (corresponds to the “Standard” tier in the legacy plan), Enterprise, and Premium. Customers from all four have access to the PingCAP support portal for service requests. Advanced features such as Technical Account Managers and [Placeholder] are also available.
The following is an overview of Connected Care services. See the [full details here](./connected-care-detail.md).

## Legacy Plans Replacement and Retirement

Even if the names of some legacy plans can be the same as those in the new Connected Care services, they referred to different plans with different service commitments. 

After a support service has officially shut down, TiDB Cloud will no longer support that particular service. If you have not transitioned to Connected Care by the relevant shutdown date, you will be transitioned to the new Connected Care “basic” service with no monthly charge.
The following table lists the current support service shutdown schedules:

| Support services | Shutdown date |
| :------ | :------ |
| Legacy “Basic” plan | Feb 15, 2025 |
| Standard plan | Feb 15, 2025 |
| Legacy “Enterprise” and “Premium” plans | Jan 15, 2026 |

## Frequently asked questions (FAQs)

### What's the difference between the legacy and the new Connected Care services?
  
In addition to the respective counterpart legacy support services:

- New Enterprise and Premium plans: A completely new set of features designed to help customers stay more “Connected” is now available. These features include: Clinic advanced monitoring service, IM subscription for Cloud alerts, IM subscription for ticket updates, AI chat in IM, and IM interaction for support tickets. 

- Developer plan: customers benefit from access to the same community and AI assistance as basic plan, while also enjoying a reduced subscription fee starting at $29 (down from $49 for the legacy "Standard" service)

- New Basic plan: customers will be guided to join the active community channels, where they can engage with other community members and interact with an AI bot for technical assistance

### How do I find out what my current support service is?

You can find the level of support by visiting the [TiDB Cloud console's Support page](https://tidbcloud.com/console/org-settings/support). Your support service is shown near the top left of the Support Overview page.

### Do I need to pay more for similar services ?

While the new Connected Care services offer a more comprehensive and feature-rich experience compared to the legacy services, the pricing remains closely aligned to the previous offerings. TiDB Cloud wholeheartedly wishes to deliver added value to better support you in this journey.

### How can I get technical support after the legacy “basic plan” technical support is no longer available?

You can continue to use Billing and Account support. For technical support, purchase a Connected Care support service. We recommend starting with the Developer plan, which includes a one-month free trial.
